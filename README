Description: This is a deep neural network model, which predicts potential drugs for protein kinase targets.

# Background
  (add background for using DNN to build this qsar model)

# Problem
  (add one sentence abstract for current challenge)

# Solution
  (how we solve the problem)

# Method
## 1 get data
#### 1.1 positive dataset was downloaded from chembl database
#### 1.2 negtive dataset was selected from pubchem database(based on a reasonable assumption that almost the compound in pubchem was NOT the substrate of a protein kinase)

## 2 build the model
#### 2.1 deep neural network was used(based on tensorflow)
#### 2.2 a 'Tree' comprises one 'Term' and several 'Branches', where the 'Term' extracts the mutual figures of all the protein kinase.

## 3 train and evaluation
    we train the model jointly and apply the model on pubchem dataset for virtual screening.
